# MapUp - Analytics Dashboard Assessment

## Overview

The objective of this assessment is to analyze the provided Electric Vehicle (EV) population data and create a frontend dashboard that visualizes key insights about the dataset. This repository contains the necessary data and instructions for demonstrating your analytical and dashboard creation skills. Feel free to use any tech stack you want to create the dashboard.

## Dataset

The Electric Vehicle Population dataset is available in the [Electric Vehicle Population Data (CSV)](./data-to-visualize/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv) within this repository. For more information about the dataset, visit the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/electric-vehicle-population).

**Note:** The dataset in this repository has been reduced to keep the data size manageable for the frontend bundle.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite**: For fast development and build process.
- **React**: For building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.
- **Chart.js / Recharts / D3.js**: For data visualization.
